Threading:
The point/path of execution is called thread, ie, main()

MultiThreading:

Test->new MyThread()->start()->Thread(Start)->MyThread->run()

To change name of the thread : Thread.setName(String name);
To get name of the thread : Thread.getName();
To find the name of the Thread class imported : Thread.getClass().getName();
To get the priority of the Thread: Thread.getPriority();
so jave provides 0 to 10 for priority. here 0 means less priority and 10 means higher priority
Java bydefault gives priority number 5 for every thread.
Once the thread is started, we cann't start it once again, otherwise we will get runtime exception saying "IlligalStateException"
We shall not use run() for thread execution because we will not get thread advantage


Runnable() interface:
For implementing interface, thread has introduced one interface which is called 
Runnable(), it consists only one method called run();

So to make the Thread Execution certain we have follwoing method to execute on thread object
1. Yield()
2. Join();
3.sleep();

1. Yield(): if this method is called on any thread object then that particular 
thread execution is delayed and other waiting thread executed first and then 
that yeilded object will be executed at last.

2.join(): if inside any thread area we write join method on any thread object
so that thread will be executed first and waiting thread would be executed last
3. Interrupted();
